graphql-analyzer-lsp: patch

Full IDE support for schema type extensions: multi-location goto-def on type names shows both base type and extensions, correct document symbol labels, order-independent extension merging, directive tracking on all schema elements, and scalar type extension support ([#633](https://github.com/trevor-scheer/graphql-analyzer/pull/633))
