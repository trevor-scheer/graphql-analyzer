Fix validate command not reporting errors from document files ([#617](https://github.com/trevor-scheer/graphql-analyzer/pull/617))

The CLI and MCP validate commands were silently ignoring validation errors from document files (TypeScript, JavaScript, GraphQL) due to a path format mismatch. Files were registered with raw filesystem paths but looked up with file:// URIs, causing lookups to fail.
