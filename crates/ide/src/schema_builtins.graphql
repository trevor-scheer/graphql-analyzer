# GraphQL specification built-in directives
# These directives are defined by the GraphQL specification and should be
# available in every schema without being explicitly defined.
#
# Note: @skip, @include, @deprecated, and @specifiedBy are already provided
# by the parser (apollo-parser). This file covers newer spec directives that
# the parser doesn't yet include as built-ins.
