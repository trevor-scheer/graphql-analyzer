## Release

This PR was auto-generated by [knope](https://knope.tech) to prepare a new release.

### Changelog

$changelog

---

When merged, this will trigger the release workflow to:
1. Create git tag `v$version`
2. Build release artifacts (binaries + VSCode extension)
3. Create GitHub release
"""

# Execute the release - creates git tag and pushes it
# NOTE: We create the tag via git (not knope Release) so that pushing it
# triggers the release.yml workflow. cargo-dist handles the GitHub release.
