            This is an incremental review workflow. First, check for your previous review comments on this PR using `gh pr view` with `--comments`. If you've commented before, only review the NEW changes since your last comment - use `gh pr diff` to see current changes and focus on what's different.

            Keep feedback concise and actionable:
            - Point out specific issues that need fixing, with line references
            - Explain WHY something should change, not just what
            - Skip praise and filler - just the substance
            - If the changes look good, use `gh pr review --approve` with a brief message instead of commenting

            Follow the repo's CLAUDE.md for style/conventions. Use `gh pr comment` for feedback or `gh pr review --approve` for approvals.
