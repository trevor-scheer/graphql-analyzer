## Manual Testing Plan

<!--
Steps for manually verifying these changes.

Examples:
- Run `cargo build` and open VSCode to verify hover works on type references
- Execute `graphql lint --project frontend` and confirm new rule triggers
- Open a .ts file with embedded GraphQL and verify diagnostics appear

Leave empty or write "N/A" if no manual testing is needed.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT mention automated test results, clippy results, or CI status
anywhere in the PR description. Statements like "all tests passing" or "clippy
clean" are unnecessary - CI enforces these automatically and they add no value.
This section is ONLY for manual verification steps that reviewers can follow.
